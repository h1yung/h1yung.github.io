Hello world! I realized that I need a personal website showcasing my creations, publications, and so on. My current objective is working in the academia, so I decided to use the academicpages template from GitHub.

This page will definitely evolve over the years to showcase my proficiencies in various web development libraries as well as add more cool website functionalities.

Stay tuned!
