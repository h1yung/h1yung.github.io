My primary research interest lies in developing robust machine learning
models under distributional shifts, particularly:
1. Concept drift, where P(Y|X) changes (out-of-distribution generalization),
and
2. Covariate shift, where P(X) changes while P(Y|X) remains stable
(including adversarial settings).
Motivated by applications in resource-constrained domains such as
healthcare (patient and lab data acquisition is expensive) and predictive
breeding (weather effect is highly stochastic across years and sampling
techniques are mostly observational), I have focused on model-centric
robustness strategies, including domain adversarial learning for domain
generalization and, more recently, neurosymbolic learning for adversarial
robustness. These approaches allow robustness to be built into the
learning objective rather than relying solely on data augmentation, which is
often infeasible in real-world settings.
