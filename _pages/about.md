Hi 👋, my name is Hyeong Kyun (Daniel, 박형균) Park, a Statistics + Computer Science Joint M.S. student in the Department of Statistics at Purdue University. I also graduated from Purdue University with B.S. Computer Science, Data Science, Applied Statistics, and a Math minor.

My primary research interest lies in developing **robust** systems under distributional shifts, including **natural drifts** and **adversarial attacks**. I also love interdisciplinary projects that make tangible progress.

In the US, more and more SOTA research is being done in industry. I believe it's an extremely important skill to also familiarize oneself in productionizing the findings from academia. For this reason, I am a strong advocate for academia-industry collaborations in AI.
