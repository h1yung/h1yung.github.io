Hi, my name is Hyeong Kyun (Daniel) Park, a Statistics + Computer Science Joint M.S. student in the Department of Statistics at Purdue University. I also graduated from Purdue University with B.S. Computer Science, Data Science, Applied Statistics, and a Math minor.

My primary research interest lies in developing robust machine learning models under distributional shifts.

I love software development, AI, and academia-industry collaborations.
